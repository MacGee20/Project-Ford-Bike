# Ford-Go-Bike Trip Dataset Exploration

## by Gift Omodu

## Dataset

> The data consist of 174952 entries from a bike ride detailing the duration of ride, start time, user types, member gender, etc. The dataset can be found in the repository.

## Summary of Findings

> In my exploration, I found that there were more male particpants than female in the ride event. Majority of the people who were invovled in the ride could only go on for less than 3hours. Only few persons were able to ride above 8 hours. Of this number, many were not customers but one-off subscribers.

> On the other hand, we had more participants within the birth year of 1975-2000. Majority were mostly solo riders as they had very few shared rides when compared to the sample size.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> On the presentation, I chose to focus on ride performance by gender. Seeing how many riders turned out in the event and the type of customers they were.
> I paired each bike id with the corresponding ride duration. Gradually, several patterns sprung up when compared to gender, user types and if the rides were shared.
